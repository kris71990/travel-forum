# Travel Forum

**Author:** Kris Sakarias

**Version** 1.0.0

## Overview

This is a travel forum application designed as a platform for users to post and discuss topics, ideas, questions, concerns, and anything else related to their travels - a platform designed for a community of travelers to interract. 

The forum is modeled after reddit or any other forum style application where users gather to post new threads, comment on existing ones, and engage with a community on a particular subject or group of topics. 

This forum is read-only for the general public. To engage with the community, a user must sign up for an account. The forum is divided into a series of subforums by geographic region. Navigate to a regional subforum and see a list of countries and threads that are currently being discussed. 

Don't see the country you're looking for? Initialize its subforum and post its first topic! Post a topic in any of the other active country subforums, or join a discussion and comment on any active thread. 

If multiple users are online, join the chat room and talk about your travels. Users can also communicate directly with eachother via private message.

Forum content is managed by the administrator, who can delegate moderator powers to specific users. Moderators can sticky important threads, delete spam comments, or lock threads that have become unruly.
